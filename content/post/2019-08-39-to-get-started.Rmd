It is the first statistical genetics group meeting at ISU, attendees from different departments (STAT, BCB ,etc) with silimar interests in statistics modelling in genetics came together, got to know each other and talked about their ideas regard to this area. 

Dr.Dorman talked about statistical modeling in genetics on three aspects: genetics, computing and statistics. The slides can be found [here](). 

We decided to make this group as a place for people to learn influential and trending methods in statistical model in genetics and also a place to present our own research. Hope we all enjoy this process :))
