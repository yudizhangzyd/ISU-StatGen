<p>This top is a good fit for people who want to know about newly developed statistical and computational methods in haplotype phasing (not only for diploids but also for polyploids)! 2 recent papers related to this topic will be discussed. Here is the summary <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/xbdhypczdvbx">slides</a>.</p>
