**Abstract: ** 

Invasive species cause large scale damages to ecosystems because of direct effects of depredation and/or competition, with native species. However, sometimes they also effect ecosystems "indirectly". In this talk, we will discuss recent work on the indirect effects of invasive ascidian species on crab-mussel predator-prey communities, in the gulf of Maine. We will also discuss the "indirect" control of pests, via boosting the efficiency of introduced predators, with additional food.
