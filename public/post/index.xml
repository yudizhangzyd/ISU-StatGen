&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker: Dr. Karin Dorman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the DREAM &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20692755/wiki/595096&#34;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;,Dr. Dorman is going to review a 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00117.pdf&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a Science &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6298/aaf7907.long&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that introduces the general background. The title and abstract of the 2019 paper is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimation of cell lineage trees bymaximum-likelihood phylogenetics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR technology has enabled large-scale cell lineage tracing for complex multicellular organismsby mutating synthetic genomic barcodes during organismal development. However, these sophisticated biological tools currently use ad-hoc and outmoded computational methods to reconstructthe cell lineage tree from the mutated barcodes. Because these methods are agnostic to thebiological mechanism, they are unable to take full advantage of the data’s structure. We propose astatistical model for the mutation process and develop a procedure to estimate the tree topology,branch lengths, and mutation parameters by iteratively applying penalized maximum likelihoodestimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DNA fragment, in Illumina paired-end (PE) sequencing, is read from both ends, resulting forward and backward reads. This can be seen as a challenge and also an opportunity to infer the DNA fragment by merging the information from the PE reads, where the alignment is involved is part of the solution.
The challenge is identifying the replicate nucleotides and combining the information. There have been numerous tools developed for merging PE reads (and this area of research is still growing). Many of these methods ignore the possibility of sequencing indels, which are rare but not impossible, or assign penalties more consistent with evolutionary rates than Illuminated sequencing rates for indels. All of these methods either ignore the quality scores or assume they can be interpreted as PHRED error probabilities. Preliminary evidence suggests that using quality based substitution penalties and appropriate indel penalties in alignment can improve read pair merging. We propose the idea of PE read merging via HMM. The alignment state is the hidden information at each site. The possible hidden states include non overlapping end regions and deletions, insertions, and match base pairs in the overlap region. We are building the scheme under a pair-hidden Markov model (pair-HMM) using the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the parameters, and the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Constrained Newton method for transcript quantification project Salmon</title>

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: RNA-seq is a deep sequencing technique used to analyze the transcriptome. One of the major interest of transcriptome is the gene expression estimation. The transcript quantification can be realized in two steps, the first is to align the reads into the transcriptome, the second step is to estimate the abundance of transcripts. The well-known project Salmon used EM algorithm in the second step, which is slow as the ridge shaped likelihood gets flat. We are considering to speed up using newton method instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This top is a good fit for people who want to know about newly developed statistical and computational methods in haplotype phasing (not only for diploids but also for polyploids)! 2 recent papers related to this topic will be discussed. Here is the summary &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.overleaf.com/read/xbdhypczdvbx&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are links to the papers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Model-Based Clustering of Illumina Microbiome Amplicon Sequence</title>
      <link>/post/model-based-clustering-of-illumina-microbiome-amplicon-sequence/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: Xiyu Peng&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next-generation amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities. One main challenge is to distinguish true biological variants from errors caused by PCR and sequencing. In the traditional analysis pipeline, such errors are eliminated by clustering reads within a sequence similarity threshold, usually 97%, and constructing operational taxonomic units (OTUs). However, the arbitrary threshold can lead to low resolution and high false-positive rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we introduce AmpliCI, a reference-free model-based method for rapidly resolving the number, abundance, and identity of error-free sequences in massive Illumina amplicon datasets. AmpliCI takes into account quality information and allows the data, rather than an arbitrary threshold or an external database, to drive the conclusion. AmpliCI estimates a mixture model, using a greedy strategy to gradually select error-free sequences while approximately maximizing the likelihood. In a simulation study, our method achieves better accuracy than competing methods, especially in communities of closely related species. AmpliCI also shows comparable or better accuracy than other methods when analyzing real mock datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;It is the first statistical genetics group meeting at ISU, attendees from different departments (STAT, BCB ,etc) with silimar interests in statistics modelling in genetics came together, got to know each other and talked about their ideas regard to this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr.Dorman talked about statistical modeling in genetics on three aspects: genetics, computing and statistics. The slides can be found &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to make this group as a place for people to learn influential and trending methods in statistical model in genetics and also a place to present our own research. Hope we all enjoy this process :))&lt;/p&gt;
