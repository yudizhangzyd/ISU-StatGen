&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
Reconstructing Gene Co-expression Network with c-level Partial Correlation Graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
A key aim in system biology is to understand molecules’ structural and functional processes in a living cell. With the development of high-throughput technologies, quantitative methods can be applied on the large scale ‘omics’ dataset. Due to the nature of intricate relationships of all molecules in a cell, network-based methods have become a popular approach to reconstruct gene-gene, gene-protein, and protein-protein interactions. Among different network approaches, Gaussian Graphical Model shows advantages in reconstructing gene co-expression networks because it is able to capture the direct association between genes with partial correlations. However, estimating and inferring partial correlations under the high-dimensional setting are very challenging. A method utilizing penalized partial correlations called exact hypothesis testing for shrinkage based Gaussian Graphical Models (Shrunk MLE) is able to overcome the high-dimension problem. However, the statistical inference of such penalized partial correlations is not satisfying. In this project, a novel network inference method, named c-level Partial Correlation Graph (c-level PCG), is applied to the gene expression dataset to model gene-gene direct association. It overcomes the ill-condition of p greater than n and successfully infers estimated partial correlation with false discovery rate controlled. Compared to Shrunk MLE, c-level PCG is able to achieve much higher statistical power and control the false discovery rate at the same time, according to our simulation studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker: Debosmita Kundu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Debosmita Kundu will talk about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687744/&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the &lt;a href=&#34;/slides/slides_kundu.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;. Brief summary is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
High-dimensional linear state space models for dynamic microbial interaction networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the abundance of bacteria—which are the predominant members of the human microbiome—in time-course studies along with appropriate mathematical models will allow us to identify key dynamic interaction networks within the microbiome. However, the high-dimensional nature of these data poses significant challenges to the development of such mathematical models. We propose a high-dimensional linear State Space Model (SSM) with a new Expectation-Regularization-Maximization (ERM) algorithm to construct a dynamic Microbial Interaction Network (MIN). System noise and measurement noise can be separately specified through SSMs. In order to deal with the problem of high-dimensional parameter space in the SSMs, the proposed new ERM algorithm employs the idea of the adaptive LASSO-based variable selection method so that the sparsity property of MINs can be preserved. We performed simulation studies to evaluate the proposed ERM algorithm for variable selection. The proposed method is applied to identify the dynamic MIN from a time-course vaginal microbiome study of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker: Dr. Karin Dorman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the DREAM &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20692755/wiki/595096&#34;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Dorman is going to review a 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00117.pdf&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a Science &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6298/aaf7907.long&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that introduces the general background. The title and abstract of the 2019 paper is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimation of cell lineage trees bymaximum-likelihood phylogenetics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR technology has enabled large-scale cell lineage tracing for complex multicellular organismsby mutating synthetic genomic barcodes during organismal development. However, these sophisticated biological tools currently use ad-hoc and outmoded computational methods to reconstructthe cell lineage tree from the mutated barcodes. Because these methods are agnostic to thebiological mechanism, they are unable to take full advantage of the data’s structure. We propose astatistical model for the mutation process and develop a procedure to estimate the tree topology,branch lengths, and mutation parameters by iteratively applying penalized maximum likelihoodestimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DNA fragment, in Illumina paired-end (PE) sequencing, is read from both ends, resulting forward and backward reads. This can be seen as a challenge and also an opportunity to infer the DNA fragment by merging the information from the PE reads, where the alignment is involved is part of the solution.
The challenge is identifying the replicate nucleotides and combining the information. There have been numerous tools developed for merging PE reads (and this area of research is still growing). Many of these methods ignore the possibility of sequencing indels, which are rare but not impossible, or assign penalties more consistent with evolutionary rates than Illuminated sequencing rates for indels. All of these methods either ignore the quality scores or assume they can be interpreted as PHRED error probabilities. Preliminary evidence suggests that using quality based substitution penalties and appropriate indel penalties in alignment can improve read pair merging. We propose the idea of PE read merging via HMM. The alignment state is the hidden information at each site. The possible hidden states include non overlapping end regions and deletions, insertions, and match base pairs in the overlap region. We are building the scheme under a pair-hidden Markov model (pair-HMM) using the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the parameters, and the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: RNA-seq is a deep sequencing technique used to analyze the transcriptome. One of the major interest of transcriptome is the gene expression estimation. The transcript quantification can be realized in two steps, the first is to align the reads into the transcriptome, the second step is to estimate the abundance of transcripts. The well-known project Salmon used EM algorithm in the second step, which is slow as the ridge shaped likelihood gets flat. We are considering to speed up using newton method instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Model-Based Clustering of Illumina Microbiome Amplicon Sequence</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: Xiyu Peng&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next-generation amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities. One main challenge is to distinguish true biological variants from errors caused by PCR and sequencing. In the traditional analysis pipeline, such errors are eliminated by clustering reads within a sequence similarity threshold, usually 97%, and constructing operational taxonomic units (OTUs). However, the arbitrary threshold can lead to low resolution and high false-positive rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we introduce AmpliCI, a reference-free model-based method for rapidly resolving the number, abundance, and identity of error-free sequences in massive Illumina amplicon datasets. AmpliCI takes into account quality information and allows the data, rather than an arbitrary threshold or an external database, to drive the conclusion. AmpliCI estimates a mixture model, using a greedy strategy to gradually select error-free sequences while approximately maximizing the likelihood. In a simulation study, our method achieves better accuracy than competing methods, especially in communities of closely related species. AmpliCI also shows comparable or better accuracy than other methods when analyzing real mock datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the first statistical genetics group meeting at ISU, attendees from different departments (STAT, BCB ,etc) with silimar interests in statistics modelling in genetics came together, got to know each other and talked about their ideas regard to this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr.Dorman talked about statistical modeling in genetics on three aspects: genetics, computing and statistics. The slides can be found &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to make this group as a place for people to learn influential and trending methods in statistical model in genetics and also a place to present our own research. Hope we all enjoy this process :))&lt;/p&gt;
