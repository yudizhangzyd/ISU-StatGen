&lt;p&gt;This top is a good fit for people who want to know about newly developed statistical and computational methods in haplotype phasing (not only for diploids but also for polyploids)! 2 recent papers related to this topic will be discussed. Here is the summary &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.overleaf.com/read/xbdhypczdvbx&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are links to the papers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Model-Based Clustering of Illumina Microbiome Amplicon Sequence</title>

&lt;p&gt;Next-generation amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities. One main challenge is to distinguish true biological variants from errors caused by PCR and sequencing. In the traditional analysis pipeline, such errors are eliminated by clustering reads within a sequence similarity threshold, usually 97%, and constructing operational taxonomic units (OTUs). However, the arbitrary threshold can lead to low resolution and high false-positive rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we introduce AmpliCI, a reference-free model-based method for rapidly resolving the number, abundance, and identity of error-free sequences in massive Illumina amplicon datasets. AmpliCI takes into account quality information and allows the data, rather than an arbitrary threshold or an external database, to drive the conclusion. AmpliCI estimates a mixture model, using a greedy strategy to gradually select error-free sequences while approximately maximizing the likelihood. In a simulation study, our method achieves better accuracy than competing methods, especially in communities of closely related species. AmpliCI also shows comparable or better accuracy than other methods when analyzing real mock datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the first statistical genetics group meeting at ISU, attendees from different departments (STAT, BCB ,etc) with silimar interests in statistics modelling in genetics came together, got to know each other and talked about their ideas regard to this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr.Dorman talked about statistical modeling in genetics on three aspects: genetics, computing and statistics. The slides can be found &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to make this group as a place for people to learn influential and trending methods in statistical model in genetics and also a place to present our own research. Hope we all enjoy this process :))&lt;/p&gt;
