This can be seen as a challenge and also an opportunity to infer the DNA fragment by merging the information from the PE reads, where the alignment is involved is part of the solution. The challenge is identifying the replicate nucleotides and combining the information. There have been numerous tools developed for merging PE reads (and this area of research is still growing). Many of these methods ignore the possibility of sequencing indels, which are rare but not impossible, or assign penalties more consistent with evolutionary rates than Illuminated sequencing rates for indels. All of these methods either ignore the quality scores or assume they can be interpreted as PHRED error probabilities. Preliminary evidence suggests that using quality based substitution penalties and appropriate indel penalties in alignment can improve read pair merging. We propose the idea of PE read merging via HMM. The alignment state is the hidden information at each site. The possible hidden states include non overlapping end regions and deletions, insertions, and match base pairs in the overlap region. We are building the scheme under a pair-hidden Markov model (pair-HMM) using the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the parameters, and the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely alignment.\n","date":1569369600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569369600,"objectID":"dbced7976ef8218b68928b61f3d38241","permalink":"/post/paired-end-reads-merging-using-pair-hidden-markov-model/","publishdate":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paired-end-reads-merging-using-pair-hidden-markov-model/","section":"post","summary":"Author: Shofi Andari\nAbstract:\nA DNA fragment, in Illumina paired-end (PE) sequencing, is read from both ends, resulting forward and backward reads.

One main challenge is to distinguish true biological variants from errors caused by PCR and sequencing. In the traditional analysis pipeline, such errors are eliminated by clustering reads within a sequence similarity threshold, usually 97%, and constructing operational taxonomic units (OTUs). However, the arbitrary threshold can lead to low resolution and high false-positive rates.\nHere, we introduce AmpliCI, a reference-free model-based method for rapidly resolving the number, abundance, and identity of error-free sequences in massive Illumina amplicon datasets. AmpliCI takes into account quality information and allows the data, rather than an arbitrary threshold or an external database, to drive the conclusion. AmpliCI estimates a mixture model, using a greedy strategy to gradually select error-free sequences while approximately maximizing the likelihood. In a simulation study, our method achieves better accuracy than competing methods, especially in communities of closely related species. AmpliCI also shows comparable or better accuracy than other methods when analyzing real mock datasets.\n","date":1567555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567555200,"objectID":"bd892e2501cbfb6df5fe681ef46cbf88","permalink":"/post/model-based-clustering-of-illumina-microbiome-amplicon-sequence/","publishdate":"2019-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/model-based-clustering-of-illumina-microbiome-amplicon-sequence/","section":"post","summary":"Author: Xiyu Peng\nNext-generation amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities.
